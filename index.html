            “Her Honda bucked sharply left. Red Bull splashed in her lap. The steering wheel went rigid in her grip and she fought it for a stomach-fluttery second (turn into the skid, turn into the skid) before twisting the vehicle back under control, still moving forward and uphill — but losing speed. Losing traction. “No, no, no.” She pumped the gas. The all-weather tires gripped and released in the sludgy snow, heaving the car in violent contractions. Steam sizzled off the hood. “Come on, Blue—”

        <h2>Why Should Read This Novel</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Full of shocking twists and turns, this beautifully written novel will have you on the edge of your seat.</li>
            <li>With exquisitely controlled pacing, Taylor Adams diabolically ratchets up the tension with every page.</li>
            <li>This book is action from start to finish.</li>
          </ol>
            <p>The first twist left me <i>"breathless"</i>. The suspense starts at the very first page and only becomes more compelling until the explosive ending. I found myself having to tell myself to stop read and just BLINK, and breathe.</p>
