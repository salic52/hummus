        <p style="color: blue"> This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years. Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads. </p>

            Why has the chickpea become so important to so many (it’s the most-widely consumed legume in the world)? Protein and lots of it, and zinc and iron, which means that chickpeas are a very good plant-based replacement for meat, especially if it’s married to certain other ingredients.

          <ol>
            <li>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely</li>

            <p>If you want a coarse <i>"chunky"</i> hummus, process it for a short time If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.</p>

          <h2 class="#FFA69E_color">Storage</h2>
            <p> Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it. Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.</p>
