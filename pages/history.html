    <h1>Origin and history</h1>
        
        
        <p>Although multiple different theories and claims of origins exist in various parts of the Middle East, evidence is insufficient to determine the precise location or time of the invention of hummus. It's basic ingredients-chickpeas, sesame, lemon, and garlic-have been combined and eaten in the Levant over centuries. Thought regional populations while we ate chickpeas, and often cooked them and stews and other hot dishes, puréed chickpeas eaten cold with tahini  do not appear before the Abbasid period in Egypt and the Levant.</p>
        
    <p>The earliest known written recipe from a dish resembling hummus bi tahina are in cookbooks written in Cairo in the 13th century. A cold puréed chickpeas with and pickled lemons with  herbs, spices, and oil, but or tahini or garlic, appears in hummus Kanz al-Fawa’id fi Tanwi’ al-Mawa’id; [11] And a puréed of chickpeas and tahini called hummus kasa  appears in the Kitab Wasf al-Atima al-Mutada: it is based on puréed chickpeas and tahini, and acidulated with vinegar (though not slime lemon), but it also contains many spices, herbs, and nut, and no garlic. It's also served by rolling it out and letting it sit overnight,[13] which presumably gives it a very different texture from hummus bi tahina.</p>
